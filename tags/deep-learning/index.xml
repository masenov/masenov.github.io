      <description>&lt;p&gt;Extracting 3D information from a scene is both a
fundamental problem in Computer Vision and one of the
field&amp;rsquo;s most valuable applications. A lot of solutions exists
using specialized hardware like 3d cameras, different
radar systems, Kinect, etc. However, all of them has trade-
offs in terms of their accuracy, price and limitations that
are usually unsatisfactory for commercial applications. In
this paper we present a method for extracting 3D
information from cameras that aims to partially mitigate
the problems that prevent them to be the cheap and
reliable solution for the stereo vision problem. Our
solution is based on Convolutional Neural Networks
which recently gained popularity for the problem of visual
recognition. We modify their architecture to be better
suited for depth map extraction and test them on both
single and multi-view camera images. Furthermore, we
make use of computer graphics generated data and
experiment with transferring our results from animated
pictures to the real ones.&lt;/p&gt;
